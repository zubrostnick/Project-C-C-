7. (Curves: Ellipse, Hyperbola, Parabola)
Consists of two directories (one for C, one for C++)


Project Description:
Create a structure (class) ELLIPSE - defined by a vector of 7 real numbers (matrix form) and/or the coordinates of the ellipse's foci and 2 radii. Functions for input, output, conversion from one form to another, area of the ellipse, finding the coordinates of the center of the ellipse, checking if a given point is inside the ellipse. Points of intersection of the ellipse with a line and another ellipse. Create a structure (class) PARABOLA - defined by a vector of 3 real numbers. Functions for input, output, finding the coordinates of the center of the parabola, checking if a given point is above the parabola, points of intersection of the parabola and a line, points of intersection of 2 parabolas, areas of these intersections. Create a structure (class) HYPERBOLA - defined by a vector of 5 real numbers. Functions for input, output, finding the coordinates of the center of the hyperbola, checking if a given point is above the parabola, points of intersection of the parabola and hyperbola, points of intersection of 2 hyperbolas, areas of these intersections.
